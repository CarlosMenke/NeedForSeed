## Desing
- Navbar should be on the left. On mobile it should unfold on button press. Unfold on default.
- Navbar should not be foldable to subpages
- Dark mode enabled (if time left, write also white mode)
- grey background (should be in some sort of config), buttons violett if pressed and so
- should be controlable via keybord in the long run

## Technical Issues
- Mobile view
- Notification to device
- Loading Screen
- share state between sites
- Css Framewrok?

## Plan for implementation
1) Login
2) show music data
